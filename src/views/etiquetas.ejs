      What is Lorem Ipsum? Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and
      typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy
      text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type
      and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only
      five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining
      essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of
      Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with
      desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of
      Lorem Ipsum.

      Why do we use it? It is a long established fact that a reader will be
      distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout.
      <b>The point of using Lorem Ipsum</b> is that it has a more-or-less normal
      distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here',
      making it look <strong> readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and
      web page editors now use</strong> Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a
      search for <u> 'lorem ipsum'</u> will uncover many web sites still in their
      infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by
      accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).

      Where does it come from? Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not
      simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature
      from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin
      professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more
      obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going
      through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the
      undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of
      "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero,
      written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very
      popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem
      ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
